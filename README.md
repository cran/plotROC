# Generate interactive ROC plots from R using ggplot

Most ROC curve plots obscure the cutoff values and inhibit
    interpretation and comparison of multiple curves. This attempts to address
    those shortcomings by providing plotting and interactive tools. Functions
    are provided to generate an interactive ROC curve plot for web use, and
    print versions. An interactive Shiny application is also included.
    
## Installation

This is the development version of the package. It can be installed from github with

```r
remotes::install_github("sachsmc/plotROC")
```

## Basic usage
