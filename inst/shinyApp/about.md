# About

Most ROC curve plots obscure the cutoff values and inhibit
    interpretation and comparison of multiple curves. This attempts to address
    those shortcomings by providing plotting and interactive tools. 

This is a web-based implementation of the `plotROC` package in `R`. You can learn more about the plotROC package here: [plotROC homepage](http://sachsmc.github.io/plotROC)
